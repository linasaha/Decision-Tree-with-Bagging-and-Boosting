# Decision-Tree-with-Bagging-and-Adaboost

Implement Bagging and AdaBoost based on decision tree from scratch and comparing result with Sci-kit Learn's implementation.

Data Sets: Mushroom Data Set1 from the UCI Repository has been used for this. There are 22 attributes in this data set, of which we have dropped the attribute (stalk-root) as it contains too many missing values. The data set has been converted from string to integer, with the unique feature values being assigned indices starting from 0 in alphabetical order. Also note that rather than performing the classical task of predicting whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible, our classification task is to predict bruises, if there's any.
